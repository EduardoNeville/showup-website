Looking at all the misc files. Create the landing page for this project explaining all the steps for users.

Use the following component libraries:

- [ ] MagicUI
- [ ] FancyComponents
- [ ] KokonutUI
- [ ] Motion-primitives
- [ ] HextaUI
- [ ] AnimeJS

I want you to make sure to configure the following.

1. Single file as the source of all theming both light mode and dark mode.
2. A resposive design for both mobile and desktop.
3. The platforms design must be clean and aesthetically pleasing with neo-classical styling. Look for other libraries to do this with.
